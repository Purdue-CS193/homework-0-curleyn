## Neth's First CS193 Homework

### Things I like about CS193
- The lectures are interesting and feel more driven towards student participation
- The attendance quizzes give a reason to attend the lectures
- Coding is fun (:
- Plenty of time to complete homework assignments
- The TAs will give you cool hacker themes for the first homework assignment
